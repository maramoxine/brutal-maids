wow a journal in a games file nerd-shit much?
sat 27/7 2024

finally solved the html5 bug of multiple hit detections on melee atk
(html5/Javascript turns handles into real numbers/structs, found a solution)
(apply solution to explotions, melee or on-contact attacks and multiple-collisions)

started this log journal thing. there was more changes before this duh
but those are there in the github commits

now gotta work on dashing, maybe replacing the melee with the grnade
and gotta work on the wave spawner system.
